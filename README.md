## **<span style="color:green">What is Apache Tomcat?</span>**

Apache Tomcat is an open-source Java Servlet Container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It provides an environment to deploy, run, and manage Java-based applications.

---

## **<span style="color:green">Why Apache Tomcat?</span>**

- **Java Application Hosting**: Designed to run Java Servlets and JSP files.
- **Lightweight and Scalable**: Provides flexibility for small to large-scale deployments.
- **Open Source**: Free and supported by an active developer community.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with build tools like Maven and repository managers like Nexus.

## **<span style="color:green">Tomcat in Our Project</span>**

In this project, Apache Tomcat is used as the primary application container to host and deploy Java-based web applications. It integrates with Maven for build automation and Nexus for artifact management.

---

### **<span style="color:green">Role of Tomcat</span>**

1. **Hosting Applications**:
   - Acts as a web server to host Java applications, ensuring a stable and efficient environment.

2. **Integration with CI/CD**:
   - Deployed artifacts from Nexus are automatically configured to run on Tomcat, ensuring seamless deployment.

3. **Application Management**:
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring, managing, and updating applications.

---

## **<span style="color:green">How Tomcat Fits into the Pipeline</span>**

1. **Build Phase**:
   - Java applications are built using Maven.

2. **Artifact Storage**:
   - Built artifacts are uploaded to Nexus repositories for version management and storage.

3. **Deployment to Tomcat**:
   - Artifacts are deployed from Nexus to Tomcat for testing and production.

### **<span style="color:green">Accessing Applications</span>**

Applications hosted on Tomcat can be accessed via a web browser at:

`http://<server-ip>:<port>/<application-name>`

---

### **<span style="color:green">Managing Tomcat</span>**

Tomcat's **Manager App** allows administrators to:
- Deploy new applications.
- Undeploy or update existing applications.
- Monitor application performance.

To access the Manager App:

`http://<server-ip>:<port>/manager`
